CDash testing scripts are executed as follows:

cd ~/
mkdir nightlyCMDVTestingCDash
cd nightlyCMDVTestingCDash
bash nightly_cron_script.sh

This will create a repos and build directory for the cloning 
of the CMDV-testing repo and the build/test running, respectively.

The output from the entire procedure is sent to the output file nightly_log.txt.

The results from the configure/build/run are sent to the following 
CDash site: http://cdash.sandia.gov/CDash-2-3-0/index.php?project=CMDV-testing
(note that this is only accessible from Sandia's SRN network).
To change to a difference site, one would need to modify ctest_nightly.cmake,
CTestConfig.cmake and Project.xml.

Note that there is no need to source init.sh to get the paths with 
this build approach.   
 
The requirement is to have cmake version 2.8 or higher.
