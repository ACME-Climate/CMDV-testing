CDash testing scripts are executed as follows:

cd ~/
mkdir nightlyCMDVTestingCDash
cp /path/to/cmdv-testing-clone/dashboards/edison.nersc.gov/* .
cd nightlyCMDVTestingCDash
source modules.sh 
bash nightly_cron_script.sh
bash process_results.sh
bash send_email.sh 

This will create a repos and build directory for the cloning 
of the CMDV-testing repo and the build/test running, respectively.

The output from the entire procedure is sent to the output file nightly_log.txt.

The results from the configure/build/run are sent to the following 
CDash site: https://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=ACME_Climate
under the Experimental section.  


NOTES:

The ctest_nightly.cmake configuration script has 2 options:

-D ENABLE_GITPYTHON:BOOL=ON/OFF
-D TESTING_OUTPUT_DIR:PATH=...

The first option should be set to OFF if a machine does not have GITPYTHON installed.

The second option lets one specify the path where the testing output directories
will be created.  By default, these will be created in /tmp/cmdv/testing. 

Note that there is no need to source init.sh to get the paths with 
this build approach.   
 
The requirement is to have cmake version 2.8 or higher. 

To modify ctest_nightly.cmake for another machine, one should search and replace
the phrase "edison" with the name of the other machine.
