This file contains instructions for configuring, building
and testing the code using cmake and ctest on Edison.  It 
can easily be modified for other machines. 

cd ~/
module purge; module load cmake 
git clone git@github.com:E3SM-Project/CMDV-testing.git CMDV-Testing
cd CMDV-Testing
mkdir build
cd build
cp ../dashboards/edison.nersc.gov/do-cmake .
./do-cmake
make -j 8
ctest -V

NOTES:

The do-cmake configuration script has 2 options:

-D ENABLE_GITPYTHON:BOOL=ON/OFF
-D TESTING_OUTPUT_DIR:PATH=...

The first option should be set to OFF if a machine does not have GITPYTHON installed.

The second option lets one specify the path where the testing output directories
will be created.  By default, these will be created in /tmp/cmdv/testing. 

Note that there is no need to source init.sh to get the paths with 
this build approach.   
 
The requirement is to have cmake version 2.8 or higher.
