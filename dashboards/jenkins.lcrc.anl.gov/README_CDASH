#no longer runs singularity image docker://cmdv/test-runner-env:latest


NOTES:

The ctest_nightly.cmake configuration script has 2 options:

-D ENABLE_GITPYTHON:BOOL=ON/OFF
-D TESTING_OUTPUT_DIR:PATH=...

The first option should be set to OFF if a machine does not have GITPYTHON installed.

The second option lets one specify the path where the testing output directories
will be created.  By default, these will be created in /tmp/cmdv/testing. 

Note that there is no need to source init.sh to get the paths with 
this build approach.   
 
The requirement is to have cmake version 2.8 or higher.
